### Credits

The Documenting the Modern School project, which led to this website, started with collaboration between Karen D. Taylor, Founder and Executive Director of [While We Are Still Here](https://whilewearestillhere.org/), and [Ansley T. Erickson, Associate Professor of History and Education Policy](https://tc.columbia.edu/faculty/ate11) and Co-Director of the [Harlem Education History Project](https://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/) and the [Center on History and Education, Teachers College, Columbia University](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/che/). The project was supported by Tina Campt through [Barnard College's Harlem Semester](https://africana.barnard.edu/harlem-semester), an action grant from [HumanitiesNY](https://humanitiesny.org/), and by the [Center on History and Education, Teachers College, Columbia University](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/che/).

In 2017 and 2019, Teachers College graduate students took a research seminar with Erickson, studied Harlem's educational history, and learned to conduct oral history interviews at a multigenerational reunion and later gatherings. Interviewers included Yianella Blanco, Ansley Erickson, Kelsey Hanf, Joshua Heitkamp, Matthew Kautz, Dominique Lester, Laura Montanari, Irene Oujo, Shellina Shidnia, Samantha Reed, and Karen D. Taylor. Mike Tyner and Joel Vargas recorded video and sound. John Fleming, Esther Cyna, Damaris Dunn, Barry Goldenberg, Rachel Klepper, and Jean Park worked with Modern School alumni during the multigenerational reunion and later events to make digital copies of their personal collections related to the school.

Modern School community members Cherilyn 'Liv' Wright, Deidre Flowers, Diana LaChatenere, and Melanie Edwards reviewed interview themes for the 2019 interviews and participated in formative discussion about this website. Modern School alumni participating in "tagging parties" to develop metadata for the items contained here: LIST
