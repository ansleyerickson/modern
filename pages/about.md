### Credits

The Documenting the Modern School project, which led to this website, started with collaboration between Karen D. Taylor, Founder and Executive Director of [While We Are Still Here](https://whilewearestillhere.org/), and [Ansley T. Erickson, Associate Professor of History and Education Policy](https://tc.columbia.edu/faculty/ate11) and Co-Director of the [Harlem Education History Project](https://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/) and the [Center on History and Education, Teachers College, Columbia University](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/che/). The project was supported by Tina Campt through [Barnard College's Harlem Semester](https://africana.barnard.edu/harlem-semester), an action grant from [HumanitiesNY](https://humanitiesny.org/), the [Edmund W. Gordon Institute for Urban and Minority Education at Teachers College](https://iume.tc.columbia.edu/) and by the Center on History and Education, Teachers College, Columbia University, which was founded through a 2011 challenge grant from the [National Endowment for the Humanities](www.neh.gov) and a major gift from Sue Ann Weinberg.

In 2017 and 2019, Teachers College graduate students took a research seminar with Erickson [link to syllabus here], studied Harlem's educational history, and learned to conduct oral history interviews at a multigenerational reunion and later gatherings. Interviewers included Yianella Blanco, Ansley Erickson, Kelsey Hanf, Joshua Heitkamp, Matthew Kautz, Dominique Lester, Laura Montanari, Irene Oujo, Shellina Shidnia, Samantha Reed, and Karen D. Taylor. Mike Tyner and Joel Vargas recorded video and sound. Rachel Klepper edited interview files, Noël Um audited transcripts, and Khadijah Akeem organized and confirmed permissions. John Fleming, Esther Cyna, Damaris Dunn, Barry Goldenberg, Rachel Klepper, and Jean Park worked with Modern School alumni during the multigenerational reunion and later events to make digital copies of their personal collections related to the school.

Modern School community members Cherilyn 'Liv' Wright, Deidre Flowers, Diana LaChatenere, and Melanie Edwards reviewed interview themes for the 2019 interviews and participated in formative discussion about this website. Modern School alumni participated in "tagging parties" to develop metadata for the items contained here: LIST

Working from their discussions, Khadijah Akeem, Nelson Luna, and Ansley Erickson developed tags for all items here, with guidance from [Archives for Black Lives](https://archivesforblacklives.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ardr_final.pdf).

In draft form this website was reviewed and edited by [LIST]
