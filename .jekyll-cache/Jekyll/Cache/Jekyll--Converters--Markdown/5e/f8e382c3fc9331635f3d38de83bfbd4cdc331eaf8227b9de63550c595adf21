<p>The Documenting the Modern School project, which led to this website, started with collaboration between Karen D. Taylor, Founder and Executive Director of While We Are Still Here, and Ansley T. Erickson, Associate Professor of History and Education and Co-Director of the Harlem Education History Project and the Center on History and Education, Teachers College, Columbia University. The project was supported by Tina Campt, then director of Barnard College’s Harlem Semester, an action grant from HumanitiesNY, and by the Center on History and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University.</p>

<p>Teachers College graduate students took a class with Erickson, studied Harlem’s educational history, and learned to conduct oral history interviews at a 2017 multigenerational reunion and at 2019 gatherings. Interviewers included Yianella Blanco, Dominique Lester, Joshua Heitkamp, Shellina Shidnia, Samantha Reed, Laura Montanari, Matthew Kautz, Kelsey Hanf, Irene Oujo, Karen D. Taylor and Ansley Erickson. Mike Tyner and Joel Vargas recorded video and sound for the project. John Fleming, Esther Cyna, Damaris Dunn, Barry Goldenberg, Rachel Klepper, and Jean Park worked with Modern School alumni during the multigenerational reunion and later events to make digital copies of their personal collections related to the school.</p>

<p>Modern School community members Cherilyn ‘Liv’ Wright, Deidre Flowers, Diana LaChatenere, and Melanie Edwards helped guide the 2019 interviews and participating in formative discussion about this website. Modern School alumni participating in “tagging parties” to develop metadata for the items contained here: LIST Working from their discussions, Khadijah Akeem, Nelson Luna, and Ansley Erickson developed tags for all items here, with guidance from <a href="https://archivesforblacklives.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ardr_final.pdf">Archives for Black Lives</a>.</p>
