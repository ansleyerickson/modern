# --------------------------------------------------------------
# COLLECTION SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Wax leverages Jekyll collections for much of its
# functionality, therefor some of the keys below are from
# Jekyll while others are Wax-specific.
# For more info, refer to:
# ~> https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/

collections:
  exhibits:
    output: true
  tmsdoc: # name of collection
    output: true # makes sure pages are output as html files
    layout: "tmsdoc_item" # the layout for the pages to use
    metadata:
      source: "tmsdoc.csv" # path to the metadata file within `_data`
    images:
      source: "raw_images/tmsdoc" # path to the directory of images within `_data`
  tmsphoto: # name of collection
    output: true # makes sure pages are output as html files
    layout: "tmsdoc_item" # the layout for the pages to use
    metadata:
      source: "tmsphoto.csv" # path to the metadata file within `_data`
    images:
      source: "raw_images/tmsphoto" # path to the directory of images within `_data`
  tmsoh: # name of collection
    output: true # makes sure pages are output as html files
    layout: "tmsoh_item" # the layout for the pages to use
    metadata:
      source: "tmsoh.csv" # path to the metadata file within `_data`
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# SEARCH INDEX SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# You can create multiple search indexes below (though only one is
# recommended!) by specifying
# an `index` file to write it to and some `collections` for it to index
# and running `$ bundle exec rake wax:search` .

search:
  main:
    index: "/search/index.json" # file the index will get written to
    collections:
      tmsdoc:
        content: true # whether or not to index page content
        fields: # the metadata fields to index
          - label
          - _date
          - contributor
          - names
          - _tags
          - description
      tmsphoto:
        content: true # whether or not to index page content
        fields: # the metadata fields to index
          - label
          - _date
          - contributor
          - names
          - _tags
          - description  
      tmsoh:

          - label
          - _date
          - description
          - interviewer

          - _tags
          - names





# --------------------------------------------------------------
# SITE MENU SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------

# submenu via `sub`.

    link: "/collection/"
  - label: "Exhibits"
